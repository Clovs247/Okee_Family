# Welcome to The Okee Family


# Info
This is a passion project I made to help organize the group of people that I'm going to the event with.

# Purpose
This app is to 
- make it so that we can discern who is going to be a driver and who will be the passengers
- Have a structured list of the items we're going to be bringing to the event.
- contains basic level information about the event, like the lineup and a map of the grounds
- also contains the links to the playlists on spotify for listening pleasure
